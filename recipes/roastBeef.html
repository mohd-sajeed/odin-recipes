    <p>This is a description of Roast Beef and Pan Gravy for Beginners</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cold butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups high quality, low-sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        
        <li><p>Step:1 Combine 1 teaspoon salt per pound of beef, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and granulated garlic in a small bowl and mix well. Set the beef on a piece of butcher paper, and apply half of salt mixture evenly to each side, tamping it on lightly with a fork. Press the sides of the roast onto any seasoning that has fallen onto the paper. Place beef on a wire rack set over a pan. Refrigerate the “dry brined” beef, uncovered, for 24 hours, turning meat over once after 12 hours.

        </p></li>
        <li><p>Step:2 Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Step:3 Heat oil in an oven-safe pan or skillet over high heat; add beef to pan and sear on both sides until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, pick up the meat and sear on the sides as well, if desired.</p></li>
        <li><p>Step:4 Turn off heat and add onions to the pan wherever they fit; top with mushrooms. Season vegetables with the 1/2 teaspoon salt. Drizzle melted butter over vegetables, and brush melted butter over beef.</p></li>
        <li><p>Step:5 Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Step:6 Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C), and continue to roast beef until desired internal temperature is reached. Begin to check temperature after 15 to 20 minutes. For medium-rare, an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of beef should reach 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). For medium, internal temperature should reach 130 to 135 degrees F (54 to 57 degrees C). Total roasting time will depend on the size of the roast.</p></li>
